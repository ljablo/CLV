# CLV
This project aims to estimate the customer lifetime value (CLV) of an online retail company's customers, based on their purchase history and behavior. CLV is a metric that measures how much a customer is worth to a business over their entire relationship. By calculating the CLV, the company can identify its most valuable customers, segment them into different groups, and design targeted marketing strategies to increase retention and loyalty.
